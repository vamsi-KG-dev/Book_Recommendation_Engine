# 📚 Book Recommendation System

A Python-based Book Recommendation System that uses **cosine similarity** and **item-based filtering** to suggest books to users based on their preferences. This project demonstrates the implementation of recommendation algorithms and offers an interactive interface for users. 🌟


## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Smart Recommendations**: Finds books similar to the ones you love.  
- 📏 **Cosine Similarity**: Measures how closely books are related.  
- 💻 **Easy to Use**: Simple and user-friendly interface.

## Algorithms Used

**Cosine Similarity**

    Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. In this system, it calculates the similarity between books based on their attributes.

**Item-Based Filtering**

    Generates recommendations by identifying similar books (items) using a similarity metric (cosine similarity in this case).
